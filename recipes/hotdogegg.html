        <p class="text">This is a personal recipe of mine, which is made whenever I am hungry and want a quick savory meal to eat.
            I usually pair this dish up with indomie noodles as they make the perfect combo with the egg helping to dilute the strong flavors
            of the noodle while the hot dog adds its own delicious texture and taste. I prefer using cheap hot dogs as better and more quality dogs
            are fit for other dishes while cheaper hot dogs are great as an accompany to other dishes. This recipe only uses 3 simple ingredients
            and the steps are very few too.
