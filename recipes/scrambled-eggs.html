        <p>This is not just any scrambled egg recipe, it's one from world-renowned chef Gordon Ramsay. This is arguably
            one of the best tasting scrambled eggs you will <em>ever</em> taste in your life, and some say that those who are
            fortunate enough to be able to make this dish temporarily went to heaven when they tasted it. Don't let the amount of
            ingredients fool you, as this scrambled egg recipe is one of the hardest ones to master, being equal in difficulty
            to the world famous Japanese omelette on demi-rice. However, if you are able to follow these directions to a T you will 
            be thanking yourself once it's all completed. Are you ready in mind and body to make this dish? Lets find out soon.
