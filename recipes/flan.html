        <p>This flan was one of the first dessert and baking recipes I ever made. It is not only simple but delicious, with its
            creamy texture from the condensed and evaporate milk along with the sweet caramel made from white sugar that just perfectly
            complements this dish. It can either be made by itself as this recipe shows or in combination with another recipe to create 
            the famous chocoflan that is enjoyed by many hispanic countries around the world. In this page, I will be detailing all the ingredients
            and steps from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">All Recipes</a> so that you can enjoy this
            simple yet delicious recipe from the comforts of your own home.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Melt sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat until liquefied and golden in color. Carefully pour hot syrup into a deep 9-inch round glass baking dish, 
                turning the dish to evenly coat the bottom; set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl. Add condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla; beat until smooth. Pour egg mixture on top of caramel in the baking dish; place in a deep roasting pan. 
                Carefully pour in enough hot water to come 1 inch up the sides of the dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until just set with a slight jiggle in the center, about 1 hour, checking after 55 minutes. Keep in mind the flan will continue to set as it cools. 
                Remove from the oven and carefully transfer baking dish to a wire rack; cool to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap to prevent a skin forming. Refrigerate for 3 hours or up to 3 days.</li>
            <li>To serve, run a knife around the edges of the dish; carefully invert onto a rimmed serving plate and let caramel sauce flow over flan.</li>
        </ol>
